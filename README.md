This branch holds everything needed to rebuild the game files on `main`. Nothing here is served to
students. The live site is on `main` (GitHub Pages):

| On `main` | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | the main link (Case A) |
| `preview/index.html`, `preview/case-a|c|d/` | the case chooser and the three cases |
| `review/` | the professor's review form (finished; results stay on the server) |
| `cloudflare/` | the results & settings server (Cloudflare Worker + D1) |
| `LICENSE.md` | terms of use (course use only, no open licence) |

The layout of `main` may have changed after this branch was saved, so check `main` before copying
files over.

## Rebuild

Needs bash, python3 with Pillow, node (used only for syntax checks) and git (the merge uses `git merge-file`).

```bash
bash build.sh                       # Case A: engine parts → build/pharma_detective_chen.html
bash rebuild_cd.sh                  # Cases C and D (merge, see below) + Case A with save-anywhere → site/case-{a,c,d}/index.html
python3 mk_main.py build/main.html  # the main link: Case A on the current engine, ORIGINAL content (age 61)
```

Where the outputs went on 4 Nov 2026:

- `site/case-a|c|d/index.html` were copied to `main:preview/case-a|c|d/index.html`.
- `build/main.html` was copied to `main:index.html`.

`rebuild_cd.sh` also runs `sync_t.sh`. That makes a test copy (`site_t/`) that talks to a local results server
instead of the real one.

## How the build works

**Case A is the engine.** `build.sh` joins the parts in this order: `g1_head.html`, `g2_body.html`, `g3*`, `g4*`, `g5*`,
`g6*`, `g7a…g7n`, then `g8_pages.js`.

**Cases C and D are full HTML sources.** They are `cd/c_orig_pregames.html` and `cd/d_orig_presim.html`. Both were
built on an older Case A, kept as `cd/a_base.html`. `rebuild_cd.sh` builds them in four steps:

1. It applies the case add-ons to fresh copies:
   - `cd/mk_cgames.py` + `cd/c_games.js`: Case C hands-on games (hypo rescue, Fosamax morning, height).
   - `cd/mk_dsim.py` + `cd/d_isim.js`: Case D inhaler demos (MDI, spacer, Respimat) with technique scores.
   - `cd/mk_dacb.py` + `cd/d_acb.js`: Case D anticholinergic sort.
   - `cd/mk_teach.py` + `cd/c_teach.js` / `cd/d_teach.js`: instructor keys and the debrief.
2. `cd/mk_cases.py` does a three-way merge of *(cd/a_base.html → current Case A)* into each case. This way every
   engine change reaches C and D. Conflicts are resolved to the engine side; C = 3 and D = 4 conflicts are expected.
   It then renames the storage keys to each case's own.
3. `mk_resume.py` adds save-anywhere to all three.
4. `mk_main.py` reverses `fix_a_age.py`, which changed the age 61 → 65 (birth date from the receipt). It also
   puts back the eight age-61 bag pictures from `assets/case_a_bags_age61.json`. That gives the main link the
   original Case A content on the current engine. **Don't run `fix_a_age.py` again: it is already applied.**
   `mk_main.py` only reads its list of edits.

## Where the content lives

| What | Case A | Cases C / D |
|---|---|---|
| Profile, problems, labs | `g3b_case.js` | `cd/c_orig_pregames.html` / `cd/d_orig_presim.html` |
| Evidence items, UI text | `g3_data.js` | same files as above |
| Story, interview, duel | `g7a_story.js`, `g7b_story.js` | same files as above |
| Myth boss, med-review missions, drugs | `g7c_boss.js`, `g7d_medrev.js` | same files as above |
| Pre/post test, reflection questions | `DEFAULT_QUESTIONS` in `g7e_editor.js` | `DEFAULT_QUESTIONS` in the case file |
| Pictures (bags, labs, receipts) | `g3img.js` | inside the case file |

Engine features that are shared by all cases:

| File | Feature |
|---|---|
| `g7g_teacher.js` | instructor pages |
| `g7k_mynotes.js` | My notes |
| `g7l_license.js` | credits / About card |
| `g7m_history.js` | My past games, including case documents once a game is finished |
| `g7n_feedback.js` | the optional feedback question at the end |

Pictures: `imgsrc.py` reads and replaces the base64 images (`get(case, key)`, `put(case, key, image)`, `keys(case)`).
`glyph.py` is the helper that was used to edit printed text on bag pictures with the printer's own glyphs.

## Rules

- **Case A-specific edits** (text or pictures) must also go into `cd/a_base.html`. Otherwise the merge carries
  them into C and D.
- **Case C / D content** is edited in its own case file. Don't change the same lines on both sides (engine and
  case file): the conflict is resolved to the engine side and the case edit is lost.
- Keep all three languages in every text: `['中文','English','ไทย']`.
- The instructor results key is a Cloudflare secret (`TEACHER_KEY`). Never put it in any file.

## Review form

`review_tpl.html` + `mk_review.py` → `review/index.html` (figures in `review/img/`). It is finished; it is kept here
for reference only.

## Tests (optional)

These need Playwright with Chromium, and node 22+ for the local results server.

- `servers.sh` starts the local web servers (8100 = `site_t`) and local results servers (8788/8789) through
  `cf/local_worker.mjs`, which runs `cf/cloudflare/src/index.js` on SQLite.
- `test_case.py` plays a whole case:
  ```bash
  CASE=c python3 test_case.py th practice
  ```
  It also takes `MOBILE=1`, `VIEW=fp` and `GAME_URL=…`. Screenshots and notes go to `t15/`.
- The other tests are smaller checks:

  | Test | Checks |
  |---|---|
  | `lic_test.py` | credits |
  | `hypo_test.py` | Case C hypo game |
  | `inhscore_test.py`, `hold_test.py` | Case D inhaler scoring |
  | `teacher_more.py CASE LANG` | instructor pages, using sessions saved by `test_case.py` |

## Content decisions (professor's review, Nov 2026)

**Case A**
- The receipt birth date means 65 years old (the preview has this). The main link still shows 61 by choice.
- Labs: TG/TC reference ranges corrected.

**Case C**
- Age 61.
- Fosamax counts as alendronate only (no vitamin D).
- Microalbumin is shown as a number only, with no A2 stage.
- Hypo rescue: candy is fine; the acarbose point was removed.
- Pre/post questions and reflection questions are case-specific.

**Case D**
- Spiolto is 2 puffs once daily.
- Berotec quantity is 1 inhaler.
- Dosing times on the bags match the times per day.
- Sinbaby is not counted in the anticholinergic sort and is not flagged for its diphenhydramine.
- The pre/post NSAID question is switched on; the pseudoephedrine question is an optional extra.
